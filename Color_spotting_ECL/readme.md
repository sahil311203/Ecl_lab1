Steps to Configure the Edge Impulse:
1. Create an Account and New Project:
 Sign up for an Edge Impulse account.
 Create a new project from the dashboard.
2. Connect a Device:

 You can use a supported development board or your smartphone as a sensor
device.
 Follow the instructions to connect your device to your Edge Impulse project.
3. Collect Data:

 Use the Edge Impulse mobile app or the Web interface to collect data from the
onboard sensors.
 For a "Hello World" project, you could collect accelerometer data, for instance.
4. Create an Impulse:

 Go to the Create impuls; page.
 Add a processing block (e.g., time-series data) and a learning block (e.g.,
classification).
 Save the impulse, which defines the machine learning pipeline.
5. Design a Neural Network:

 Navigate to the NN Classifier under the Learning blocks.
 Design a simple neural network. Edge Impulse provides a default architecture that
works well for most basic tasks.

6. Train the Model:

 Click on the Start training button to train your machine learning model with the
collected data.
7. Test the Model:

 Once the model is trained, you can test its performance with new data in the
Model Testing tab.
8. Deploy the Model:

 Go to the Deployment tab.
 Select the deployment method that suits your edge device (e.g., Arduino library,
WebAssembly, container, etc.).

 Follow the instructions to deploy the model to your device.
9. Run Inference:

 With the model deployed, run inference on the edge device to see it classifying
data in real-time.

10. Monitor:

 You can monitor the performance of your device through the Edge Impulse
